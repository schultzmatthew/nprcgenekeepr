## Prior to forcing the pedigree to have id, sire, and dam as character vectors
## inside calcFG, the two calculations above with ped (characters) and
## feFactors (factors) resulted 2.189855 and 1.857998 respectively.
##
## Used example from Analysis of Founder Representation in Pedigrees: Founder
## Equivalents and Founder Genome Equivalents.
## Zoo Biology 8:111-123, (1989) by Robert C. Lacy
## He presented 2.18 as the answer, which was truncated and not precise enough
## for this specific comparison.
