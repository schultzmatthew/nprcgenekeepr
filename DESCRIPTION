Description: Provides genetic tools for colony management and is a derivation 
    of the work in Amanda Vinson and Michael J Raboin (2015) 
    <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4671785/> "A Practical 
    Approach for Designing Breeding Groups to Maximize Genetic Diversity in a 
    Large Colony of Captive Rhesus Macaques ('Macaca' 'mulatto')".
    It provides a 'Shiny' application with an exposed API. 
    The application supports five groups of functions: 
    (1) Quality control of studbooks contained in text files or 'Excel' 
    workbooks and of pedigrees within 'LabKey' Electronic Health Records 
    (EHR); 
    (2) Creation of pedigrees from a list of animals using the 'LabKey' EHR 
    integration; 
    (3) Creation and display of an age by sex pyramid plot of the living 
    animals within the designated pedigree; 
    (4) Generation of genetic value analysis reports; and 
    (5) Creation of potential breeding groups with and without proscribed sex 
    ratios and defined maximum kinships.
