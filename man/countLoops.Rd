\title{Count the number of loops in a pedigree tree.}
\usage{
countLoops(loops, ptree)
}
\arguments{
\item{loops}{a named list of logical values where each named element is
named with an \code{id} from \code{ptree}. The value of the list element
is set to \code{TRUE} if the \code{id} has a loop in the pedigree.
Loops occur when an animal's sire and dam have a common ancestor.}

\item{ptree}{a list of lists forming a pedigree tree as constructed by
\code{createPedTree(ped)} where \code{ped} is a standard pedigree dataframe.}
}
\value{
A list indexed with each ID in the pedigree tree (\code{ptree})
containing the number of loops for each individual.
}
\description{
Part of Pedigree Sampling
From PedigreeSampling.R
2016-01-28
}
\details{
Contains functions to build pedigrees from sub-samples
of genotyped individuals.

The goal of sampling is to reduce the number of inbreeding
loops in the resulting pedigree, and thus, reduce the
amount of time required to perform calculations with
SIMWALK2 or similar programs.


Uses the \code{loops} data structure and the list of all ancestors for
each individual to calculate the number of loops for each individual.

\examples{
\donttest{
library(nprcgenekeepr)
exampleTree <- createPedTree(nprcgenekeepr::examplePedigree)
exampleLoops <- findLoops(exampleTree)
## You can count how many animals are in loops with the following code.
length(exampleLoops[exampleLoops == TRUE])
## You can count how many loops you have with the following code.
nLoops <- countLoops(exampleLoops, exampleTree)
sum(unlist(nLoops[nLoops > 0]))
## You can list the first 10 sets of ids, sires and dams in loops with
## the following line of code:
examplePedigree[exampleLoops == TRUE, c("id", "sire", "dam")][1:10, ]
}
