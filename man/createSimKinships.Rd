\title{Makes a list object of kinship matraces from simulated pedigrees of possible
parents for animals with unknow parents}
\usage{
createSimKinships(ped, allSimParents, pop = NULL, cumulative = FALSE, n = 10L)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{The pedigree information in data.frame format}

\item{allSimParents}{list made up of lists where the internal list
has the offspring ID \code{id}, a vector of representative sires
(\code{sires}), and a vector of representative dams(\code{dams}).}

\item{pop}{Character vector with animal IDs to consider as the population of
interest. The default is NULL.}

\item{cumulative}{logical where if \code{FALSE} a list of lenght \code{n}
long of simulated kinship matraces is generated and if \code{FALSE} a named
list of length 2 is generated where the first element is the mean of the
simulated kinships and the second element is the standard deviation of the
simulated kinships.}

\item{n}{integer value of the number of simulated pedigrees to generate.}
}
\description{
\code{createSimKinships} uses \code{makeSimPed} with the \code{ped} object
and the \code{allSimParents} object to create a set of kinship matraces to
be used in forming the \emph{Monte Carlo} estimates for the kinship values.
