\title{Gets a list of representative sires and dams for an individual obtained by
searching pedigree.}
\usage{
getRepresentativeParents(id, ped)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{character vector of length 1 containing an animal ID from with
the associated pedigree.}

\item{ped}{datatable that is the `Pedigree`. It contains pedigree
information. The \code{id} column is required.}
}
\description{
Representative sires and dams are defined as animals are to have the
following characteristics.
\enumerate{
\item{Alive at the time of birth}{This is okay for dams but weak for sires
      as sire could have died prior to birth. This should be strengthed
      with a gestational time estimate. A gestational time of 0 is
      currently used.}
\item{}
}
The function getRepresentativeParents is used to find representative parents
within the pedigree that could have been the parent for an animal born within
the pedigree that does not have one or more parents identified. These
representative parents are then used to calculate an estimated kinship
coefficient by averaging the kinship coefficient of the sires and of the
dams.
}
\details{
The current strategy is to use all representative parents as defined by the
criteria above. This could be enhanced by allowing the user to provide
a list of representative parents if available. This could be easily handled.
