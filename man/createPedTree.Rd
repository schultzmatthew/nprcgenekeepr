Part of Pedigree Sampling
From PedigreeSampling.R
2016-01-28

Contains functions to build pedigrees from sub-samples
of genotyped individuals.

The goal of sampling is to reduce the number of inbreeding
loops in the resulting pedigree, and thus, reduce the
amount of time required to perform calculations with
SIMWALK2 or similar programs.


This function uses only \code{id}, \code{sire}, and \code{dam} columns.
