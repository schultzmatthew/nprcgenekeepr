\title{Check parent ages to be at least \code{minParentAge}}
\usage{
checkParentAge(sb, minParentAge = 2, reportErrors = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sb}{A dataframe containing a table of pedigree and demographic
information.}

\item{minParentAge}{numeric values to set the minimum age in years for
an animal to have an offspring. Defaults to 2 years. The check is not
performed for animals with missing birth dates.}

\item{reportErrors}{logical value if TRUE will scan the entire file and
make a list of all errors found. The errors will be returned in a
list of list where each sublist is a type of error found.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing rows for each animal where one or more
parent was less than \code{minParentAge}. It contains all of the columns
in the original \code{sb} dataframe with the following added columns:
\enumerate{
\item {sireBirth} {sire's birth date}
\item{sireAge} {age of sire in years on the date indicated by \code{birth}.}
\item{damBirth} {dam's birth date}
\code{damAge} {age of dam in years on the date indicated by \code{birth}.}
}
}
\description{
Ensure parents are sufficiently older than offspring
