\title{Generates a kinship matrix.}
\usage{
kinship(id, father.id, mother.id, pdepth, sparse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{character vector of IDs for a set of animals.}

\item{father.id}{character vector or NA for the IDs of the sires for the set
of animals.}

\item{mother.id}{character vector or NA for the IDs of the dams for the set
of animals.}

\item{pdepth}{integer vector indicating the generation number for each
animal.}

\item{sparse}{logical flag. If \code{TRUE}, \code{Matrix::Diagnol()} is
used to make a unit diagonal matrix. If \code{FALSE}, \code{base::diag()} is
used to make a unit square matrix.}
}
\value{
A kinship square matrix
}
\description{
{Kinship Matrix Functions} {
The code for the kinship function was written by Terry Therneau
at the Mayo clinic and taken from his website. This function is part of a
package written in S (and later ported to R) for calculating kinship and
other statistics.
}
}
\details{
The function previously had an internal call to the kindepth function in
order to provide the parameter pdepth (the generation number). This version
requires the generation number to be calculated elsewhere and passed into
the function.

The rows (cols) of founders are just .5 * identity matrix, no further
   processing is needed for them.
Parents must be processed before their children, and then a child's
   kinship is just a sum of the kinship's for his/her parents.
