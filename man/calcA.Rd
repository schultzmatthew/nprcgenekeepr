\title{Calculates \code{a}, the number of an individual's alleles that are rare in
each simulation.}
\usage{
calcA(alleles, threshold = 1, byID = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{alleles}{a matrix with {id, parent, V1 ... Vn} providing the alleles
an animal received during each simulation.
The first 2 columns provide the animal ID and the parent the allele came
from. Remaining columns provide alleles.}

\item{threshold}{an integer indicating the maximum number of copies of an
allele that can be present in the population for it to be considered rare.
Default is 1.}

\item{byID}{logical variable of length 1 that is passed through to
eventually be used by \code{alleleFreq()}, which calculates the count of each
 allele in the provided vector. If \code{byID} is TRUE and ids are provided,
 the function will only count the unique alleles for an individual
  (homozygous alleles will be counted as 1).}
}
\value{
A matrix with named rows indicating the number of unique alleles
  an animal had during each round of simulation (indicated in columns).
