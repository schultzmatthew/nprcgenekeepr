## Running Shiny Application  

The toolset available within nprcgenekeepr can be used inside standard R scripts.
However, it was originally designed to be used within a Shiny application 
that can be started with:

```{r running-shiny-application, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(nprcgenekeepr)
runGeneKeepR()
```
