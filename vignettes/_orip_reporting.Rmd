## ORIP Reporting
The ORIP Reporting tab will eventually contain information for reporting to the
Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (ORIP). This tab may end up being merged
with the Summary Statistics tab and contain a number of statistics, tables and
histograms. Alternatively, this may contain a subset of information from the
Summary Statistics tab presented as a formatted report that can be exported and
submitted to ORIP. The exact information that needs to be submitted for ORIP
recordkeeping is still under discussion.
