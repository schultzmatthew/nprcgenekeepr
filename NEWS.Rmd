# nprcgenekeepr 1.0.5 (20210328)
-   Major changes -- none
-   Minor changes
    -   CRAN submission primarily in response to a change in `shiny 1.6` that
        removed an internal `shiny` function (`shiny:::%OR%`) and replaced it
        with `rlang::%||%`
    -   Stale URL in historical documentation that were causing notes to be 
        generated in automated tests have been removed.
    -   A URL referring to Terry Therneau's page was updated from "http" to 
        "https".
    -   I have incremented the version from 1.0.4 (github.com only version) to 
        1.0.5, updated NEWS to reflect the changes, and updated all 
        documentation to reflect the version change.
        
# nprcgenekeepr 1.0.4.9003 (20210318)
-   Major changes -- none
-   Minor changes
    -   Testing .travis.yml code change to get textshaping to build on all 
        systems..
    -   Cleaned up .travis.yml in response to syntax checking on travis.org.
    -   Added `markdown` to suggest due to new changes in `knitr`.
    
# nprcgenekeepr 1.0.4 (20210318)
-   Major changes -- none
-   Minor changes
    -   Added suppression of warnings from DT at beginning of server.R since
        it is unlikely for anyone to call affected functions in the controlled
        environment.
    -   Changed call to shiny:::`%OR%` to rlang::`%||%` in server.R since the
        update to 1.6 of shiny broke the code. Thanks to Dan Metzger of 
        Wisconsin National Primate Research Center.
        
# nprcgenekeepr 1.0.3 (20200526)
-   Major changes -- none
-   Minor changes
    -   CRAN re-submission: responded to the two requests provided by reviewer
        - I have removed the capitalization from "Genetic Tools for Colony 
          Management" and "Genetic Value Analysis Reports" within DESCRIPTION.
        - I have removed the conditional installation of DT from the ui.R file.
    -   I have incremented the version from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3, updated NEWS to 
        reflect the changes, and updated all documentation to reflect the 
        version change.

# nprcgenekeepr 1.0.2 (20200517)
-   Major changes -- none
-   Minor changes
    -   CRAN re-submission: responded to all requests provided by reviewer
        -   I have not changed the capitalization of `Shiny` in the description section
            of the DESCRIPTION file as it is the name of the type of application and is
            not being used as the name of the package. The use of the capitalization is
            consistent with the capitalization used within the documentation for the
            `shiny` package (?shiny, See the Details section, first sentence where it
            is used as the type of tutorial.) and all documentation and tutorials 
            provided by the author and RStudio where it is capitalized everywhere 
            except when referring to the package.
        -   I have continued to use dontrun for the following examples:
            -   runGeneKeepr(), which starts the Shiny application
            -   getFocalAnimalPed(), which is dependent on a valid LabKey instance,
                a proper configuration file, and a .netrc or _netrc authentication file.
        -   I have exchanged dontrun for donttest for the following examples:
            -   create_wkbk()
            -   createPedTree()
            -   findLoops()
            -   countLoops()
            -   All 11 examples in data.R
            -   makeExamplePedigreeFile
            
# nprcgenekeepr 1.0.1 (20200510)
-   Major changes -- none
-   Minor changes
    -   CRAN re-submission: responded to all requests provided by reviewer
        -  Reduced the time required for unit test from over 12 minutes to 21.6 
           seconds by skipping those test dependent on stochastic creation of 
           simulated pedigrees and breeding groups when not running on my system.
        -  Reduced the time to run examples and create vignettes by reducing the 
           number of stochastic modeling iterations by orders of magnitude without 
           reducing the examples provided for user-facing functions.
        -  Checking (--as-cran --run-donttest) Duration: 2m 21.8s on my system.
        -  The files with the Rd-tag of \arguments missing do not take arguments.
        -  Corrected private referencing (:::) for exported functions.
        -  Exported all functions used in examples to remove private referencing 
           (:::).
        -  Removed all single quotes on names, abbreviations, initialisms, and,
           acronyms.
        -  The phrase Electronic Health Records (EHR) is the name of a module within
           LabKey, which this software can use as a source of pedigree information
           so the capitalization is appropriate.
        -  Two exported functions used by server.R to call tabpanel() do not 
           have examples.

        of the supporting files and functions. Having good unit test coverage of
        the functions (739 test with > 90 percent coverage) made this possible.
     -   This is the last version under the nprcmanager repository name.
     -   Conversion worked

    -   Added code prior to changing `par()` in _getPyramidPlot.R_ to reset `par()` 
        with   
        `opar <- par(no.readonly =TRUE)`  
        `on.exit(par(opar))`   
    -   Removed the word "Implements" from the title.

-   Improved checkRequiredCols, toCharacter and getDatedFileName functions
-   Exported set_seed. This will be moved into rmsutilityr
-   Removed erroneous toCharacter documentation
-   Added set_seed
    -    Tried unsuccessfully to use the RNGkind function and the sample.kind
         argument to set.seed, but found neither existed prior to R 3.6.
    -    Created a R version sensitive version of set_seed that duplicates
         the pre-R version 3.6 set.seed function. This is only useful for
         creating data structures for testing purposes and should not be used
         to set seeds for large simulations

# nprcmanager 0.5.13 (20190508)
-   Updated unit tests that were using set.seed to use a R version sensitive
    set.seed wrapper.
    
# nprcmanager 0.5.12 (20190507)
-   Updated nprcmanager.R to add __Pedigree Testing__ and __Plotting__ function
    lists.

-   Added unit test for fillGroupMembersWithSexRatio()

# nprcmanager 0.5.09 (20190428)
-   Corrected bug where parents with suspicious dates were not being reported.
-   Improved display of parents with suspicious dates by outputing HTML table
    to the ErrorTab.

# nprcmanager 0.5.08 (20190418)
-   Minor rewording of option label on breeding group formation tab

# nprcmanager 0.5.07 (20190408)
-   Rearranged and reformatted breeding group formation tab

# nprcmanager 0.5.06 (20190407)
-   Changed spelling of gu.iter and gu.thresh to guIter and guThresh

# nprcmanager 0.5.05 (20190406)
-   Fixed all but one bug associated with having multiple dynamically generated
    seed animal groups.
-   Added global definition of MAXGROUPS, which is current set as 10 and allows 
    up to six seed animal groups.
-   Corrected test_fillBins, which was erroneously using a current date instead 
    of a fixed date for calculating age.
    
# nprcmanager 0.5.04 (20190225)
-   Adding ability to have up to six seed animal groups.
-   Added conditional appearance of Make Groups action button that is 
    dependent on the user having select on of the optional group formation
    workflows.
    
# nprcmanager 0.5.03 (20190215)
-   Adding new version of breeding group formation UI and related server
    code.
    
# nprcmanager 0.5.02 (20190103)
-   Added ability to specify sex ratio in increments of 0.5 (Female/Male) 
    from 0.5 to 10 in increments of 0.5.
    
# nprcmanager 0.5.01 (20181230)
-   Correction of some bugs in harem creation and provided additional
    unit tests for harem creation to prevent regression.
    
# nprcmanager 0.5.00 (20181228)
-   First draft with harem group creation working.
    -   Fails if more than one potential sire (male and at least of minimum 
        age) is in the current group.
    -   Fails if there are insufficient males to have one per breeding group
        being formed.
    -   Requires the user to provide males in the candidate set that are 
        appropriate for breeding as the current code does not check to 
        ensure the animals are still alive. This could easily be added.
    -   Males are selected for each group randomly at each iteration just
        as are all other members. The only difference between animal 
        selection for harems is that sex is part of the selection process.
    -   This required the creation of a few functions and modification of 
        others. Unit tests were updated to reflect changes, but not additions.
        New unit tests are needed.
    -   The format of the breeding group creation page must be improved.
    -   The changes made and the new unit tests will serve to simplify adding
        the sex ratio criterion to breeding group formation.
        
# nprcmanager 0.4.23 (20181226)
-   Added code to detect LabKey connection failure and report it on an Error tab

# nprcmanager 0.4.22 (20181224)
-   Minor text changes to Input tab. Refactored groupAddAssign function to
    have a function create the return list.
    
# nprcmanager 0.4.20 (20181222)
-   Refactor of __groupAddAssign__ function by extracting much of the function
    into separate functions. One such function, __fillGroupMembers__ isolates
    the group formation code to allow adding the ability to satisfy sex ratio
    requirements and harem creation.
    
# nprcmanager 0.4.19 (20181217) 
-   All minor interface changes
    -   Substituted hovertext for description of minimum parental age
    -   Added meeting notes for 20181210 meeting
    -   Changed label on button controlling reading of pedigree information
    -   Updated logo
-   Added code of conduct file.
-   Corrected license text

# nprcmanager 0.4.18 (20181210)
-   Added unit test for removing animals added to pedigree because they are 
    unknown parents

# nprcmanager 0.4.17 (20181208)
-   Changed error reporting so as not to report as an error the wrong sex when 
    animals are added into the pedigree
    and appear as both a sire and dam without an ego record. 
    The error report now indicates these are both a sire and a dam. 
    Done 20181208
-   Made a combined logo for Oregon and SNPRC. Have ONPRC on top using blue and
    green. Done 20181208
-   Additional unit 
    tests to cover all of the new functions created to handle the PEDSYS and
    military formatted dates (YYYYMMDD) have been made. Done 20181112
-   Corrected breeding groups formation, which was including unknown animals 
    that 
    had been added as placeholders for unknown parents. Done 20181119
-   Hardened LabKey code by trapping a bad base URL in the configuration file
    with a tryCatch function and send a message to the log file. This needs to be
    tested with a working LabKey system.
