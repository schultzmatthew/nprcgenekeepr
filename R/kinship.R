#' Generates a kinship matrix.

#'
#' The function previously had an internal call to the kindepth function in
#' order to provide the parameter pdepth (the generation number). This version
#' requires the generation number to be calculated elsewhere and passed into
#' the function.
#'
#' The rows (cols) of founders are just .5 * identity matrix, no further
#'    processing is needed for them.
#' Parents must be processed before their children, and then a child's
#'    kinship is just a sum of the kinship's for his/her parents.
#'
#' @return A kinship square matrix

#' @param id character vector of IDs for a set of animals.
#' @param father.id character vector or NA for the IDs of the sires for the set

#' of animals.
#' @param pdepth integer vector indicating the generation number for each
#' animal.
#' @param sparse logical flag. If \code{TRUE}, \code{Matrix::Diagnol()} is
#' used to make a unit diagonal matrix. If \code{FALSE}, \code{base::diag()} is
#' used to make a unit square matrix.
