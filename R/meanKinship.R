#' The mean kinship of animal \emph{i} is \deqn{MK_i = \Sigma f_ij / N},
#' in which the summation is over all animals, \emph{j}, including the kinship
#' of animal \emph{i} to itself.
#'
#' @return A named numeric vector of average kinship coefficients for each
#' animal ID. Elements are named with the IDs from the columns of kmat.
