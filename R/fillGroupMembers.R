#' @return A list of animal groups and their member animals
#'
#' @param candidates character vector of IDs of the animals available for
#' use in the group.
#' @param currentGroups list of character vectors of IDs of animals currently
#' assigned
#' to the group. Defaults to character(0) assuming no groups are existent.
#' @param kin list of animals and those animals who are related above a
#' threshold value.
#' @param ped dataframe that is the `Pedigree`. It contains pedigree
#' information including the IDs listed in \code{candidates}.
#' @param harem logical variable when set to \code{TRUE}, the formed groups
#' have a single male at least \code{minAge} old.
#' @param minAge integer value indicating the minimum age to consider in group
#' formation. Pairwise kinships involving an animal of this age or younger will
#'  be ignored. Default is 1 year.
#' @param numGp integer value indicating the number of groups that should be
#' formed from the list of IDs. Default is 1.
#' @param sexRatio numeric value indicating the ratio of females to males x
#' (from 0.5 to 20 by increments of 0.5 within the accompanying Shiny
#' application. A sex ratio of 0 ignores sex in making up groups.
