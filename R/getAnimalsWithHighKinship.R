#' @return a list of named character vectors where each name is an animal Id
#' and the character vectors are made up of animals sharing a kinship value
#' greater than our equal to the \code{threshold} value.
#'
#' @param kmat numeric matrix of pairwise kinship values. Rows and columns
#' are named with animal IDs.
#' @param ped dataframe that is the `Pedigree`. It contains pedigree
#' information including the IDs listed in \code{candidates}.
#' @param threshold numeric value indicating the minimum kinship level to be
#' considered in group formation. Pairwise kinship below this level will be
#' ignored.
#' @param currentGroups list of character vectors of IDs of animals currently assigned
#' to the group. Defaults to character(0) assuming no groups are existant.
#' @param ignore list of character vectors representing the sex combinations
#' to be ignored. If provided, the vectors in the list specify if pairwise
#' kinship should be ignored between certain sexes.
#' Default is to ignore all pairwise kinship between females.
#' @param minAge integer value indicating the minimum age to consider in group
#' formation. Pairwise kinships involving an animal of this age or younger will
#'  be ignored. Default is 1 year.
