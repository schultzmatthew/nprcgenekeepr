## Summary of Major Functions  

### Quality Control
Studbooks maintained by breeding colonies generally contain
information of varying quality. The quality control functions
of the toolkit check to ensure all animals listed as parents
have their own line entries, all parents have
the appropriate sex listed, no animals are
listed as both a sire and a dam, duplicate entries are removed, 
pedigree generation numbers are added,
and all dates are valid dates. 
In addition, exit dates are
added if possible and are consistent with other information such as 
departure dates and death dates. 
Current ages of animals that are still alive are added if a database connection
is provided via a configuration file and the user has read permission on a
LabKey server with the demographic data in an __EHR__ (Electronic Health Record) 
module. See 

Parents with ages below a user selected threshold are identified.
A minimum parent age in years is set by the user
and is used to ensure each parent is at least that age on the birth date of
an offspring. 
The minimum parent age defaults to 2 years. 
This check is not performed for animals with missing birth dates.

### Creation of Pedigree From a List of Potential Breeders and LabKey Integration

The user can enter a list of focal animals in a CSV file that will be used to 
create a pedigree containing all direct relative (ancestors and descendants)
via the **labkey.selectRows** function within the **Rlabkey** package
if a database connection
is provided via a configuration file and the user has read permission on a
LabKey server with the demographic data in an __EHR__ (Electronic Health Record) 
module.

Two configuration files are needed to use the database features of nprcgenekeepr
with LabKey. 
The first file is named **\_netrc** on Microsoft Windows operating systems and 
**.netrc** otherwise, allows the user to authenticate with LabKey through the 
LabKey API and is fully 
described by [LabKey documentation](https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=netrc)

The second file is named **\_nprcgenekeepr_config** on Microsoft Windows 
operating systems and **.nprcgenekeepr_config** otherwise and is the 
`nprcgenekeepr` 
[configuration file](https://github.com/rmsharp/nprcgenekeepr/blob/master/inst/extdata/example_nprcgenekeepr_config)
An image of this example configuration file is included as a data object and can 
be loaded and viewed with the following lines of R code in the R console.
```{r include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data("exampleNprcgenekeeprConfig")
View(exampleNprcgenekeeprConfig)

```

### Display of an age by sex pyramid plot

The most important demographic characteristic of a population is its age-sex structure. 
Age-sex pyramids (also known as population pyramids) graphically display this information to improve understanding and make comparison easy. The population pyramid sometimes has a distinctive pyramid-like shape when displaying a growing population. 

#### How to Read the Age-Sex Graph

An age-sex pyramid breaks down a population into male and female genders and 
age ranges. Usually, you'll find the left side of the pyramid graphing the 
male population and the right side of the pyramid displaying the female 
population.

Along the horizontal axis (x-axis) of a population pyramid, the graph 
displays the population either as a total population of that age or as 
a percentage of the population at that age. The center of the pyramid 
starts at zero population and extends out to the left for males and right
for females in increasing size, or proportion of the population. 

Along the vertical axis (y-axis), age-sex pyramids display two-year age 
increments, from birth at the bottom to old age at the top.


### Genetic Value Analysis Reports
The Genetic Value Analysis is a ranking scheme developed at ONPRC to
indicate the relative breeding value of animals in the colony. The
scheme uses the mean kinship for each animal to indicate how
inter-related it is with the rest of the current breeding colony
members. Genome uniqueness is used to provide an indication of
whether or not an animal is likely to possess alleles at risk
of being lost from the colony. Under the scheme, animals with low
mean kinship or high genome uniqueness are ranked more highly.

### Breeding Group Formation
One of the goals in breeding group formation is to avoid the
potential for mating of closely related animals. Since behavioral
concerns and housing constraints will also be taken into account
in the group formation process, it is our goal to provide the largest
number of animals possible from a list of candidates that can be housed
together without risk of consanguineous mating. To that end, this
function uses information from the Genetic Value Analysis to search
for the largest combinations of animals that can be produced from
a list of candidates.

The default options do not consider the sex of individuals when forming
the groups, though this has likely been a consideration by the user 
in selecting the candidate group members. 
Optionally the user may select to form harem groups,
which considers the sex of individuals when forming groups and restricts the 
number of males to one per group.
