\title{Calculates the sex ratio (number of non-males / number of males) given
animal Ids and their pedigree}
\usage{
calculateSexRatio(ids, ped, additionalMales = 0, additionalFemales = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{character vector of animal Ids}

\item{ped}{datatable that is the `Pedigree`. It contains pedigree
information including the IDs listed in \code{candidates}.}

\item{additionalMales}{Integer value of males to add to those within the
group when calculating the ratio. Ignored if calculated ratio is 0 or Inf.
Default is 0.}

\item{additionalFemales}{Integer value of females to add to those within the
group when calculating the ratio. Ignored if calculated ratio is 0 or Inf.
Default is 0.}
}
\value{
Numeric value of sex ratio of the animals provided.
}
\description{
The Males are counted when the \code{ped$sex} value is
\code{"M"}.
When females are counted when the \code{ped$sex} value is not
\code{"M"}. This means animals with ambiguous sex are counted with the
females.
