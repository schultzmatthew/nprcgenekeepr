\title{Calculates genome uniqueness for each ID that is part of the population.}
\usage{
calcGU(alleles, threshold = 1, byID = FALSE, pop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{alleles}{dataframe of containing an \code{AlleleTable}. This is a
table of allele information produced by \code{geneDrop()}.
An AlleleTable contains information about alleles an ego has inherited.
It contains the following columns:
\itemize{
 \item {id} {--- A character vector of IDs for a set of animals.}
 \item {parent} {--- A factor with levels of sire and dam.}
 \item {V1} {--- Unnamed integer column representing allele 1.}
 \item {V2} {--- Unnamed integer column representing allele 2.}
 \item {...} {--- Unnamed integer columns representing alleles.}
 \item {Vn} {--- Unnamed integer column representing the nth column.}}}

\item{threshold}{an integer indicating the maximum number of copies of an
allele that can be present in the population for it to be considered rare.
Default is 1.}

\item{byID}{logical variable of length 1 that is passed through to
eventually be used by \code{alleleFreq()}, which calculates the count of each
allele in the provided vector. If \code{byID} is TRUE and ids are provided,
the function will only count the unique alleles for an individual
(homozygous alleles will be counted as 1).}

\item{pop}{character vector with animal IDs to consider as the population of
interest, otherwise all animals will be considered. The default is NULL.}
}
\value{
Dataframe \code{rows: id, col: gu}
 A single-column table of genome uniqueness values as percentages.
 Rownames are set to 'id' values that are part of the population.

Part of Genetic Value Analysis

The following functions calculate genome uniqueness according to the equation
described in Ballou & Lacy.

It should be noted, however that this function differs slightly in that it
does not distinguish between founders and non-founders in calculating the
statistic.

Ballou & Lacy describe genome uniqueness as "the proportion of simulations
in which an individual receives the only copy of a founder allele." We have
interpreted this as meaning that genome uniqueness should only be calculated
for living, non-founder animals. Alleles possessed by living founders are
not considered when calculating genome uniqueness.

We have a differing view on this, since a living founder can still contribute
to the population.
The function below calculates genome uniqueness for all living animals
and considers all alleles. It does not ignore living founders and their
alleles.

Our results for genome uniqueness will, therefore differ slightly from those
returned by Pedscope. Pedscope calculates genome uniqueness only for
non-founders and ignores the contribution of any founders in the population.
This will cause Pedscope's genome uniqueness estimates to possibly be
slightly higher for non-founders than what this function will calculate.

The estimates of genome uniqueness for founders within the population
calculated by this function should match the "founder genome uniqueness"
measure calculated by Pedscope.
