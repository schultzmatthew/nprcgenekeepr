#'
#' Creates a CEPH-style pedigree for each id, consisting of three generations:
#' the id, the parents, and the grandparents. Inserts NA for unknown pedigree
#' members.
#'
#' Calculates the first-order relationships in a pedigree,
#' and to convert pairwise kinships to the appropriate relationship category.

#' Relationships categories:
#' For each ID in the pair, find a CEPH-style pedigree and compare them
#' \itemize{
#' \item {If one is the parent of the other}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{parent-offspring}}
#' \item {Else if both parents are shared}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{full-siblings}}
#' \item {Else if one parent is shared}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{half-siblings}}
#' \item {Else if one is the grandparent of the other}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{grandparent-grandchild}}
#' \item {Else if both grand parents are shared}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{cousin}}
#' \item {Else if at least one grand parent is shared}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{cousin - other}}
#' \item {Else if the parents of one are the grandparents of the other}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{full-avuncular}}
#' \item {Else if a single parent of one is the grandparent of the other}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{avuncular - other}}
#' \item {Else if the kinship is greater than 0, but the pair don't fall into
#' the above categories}
#'     {--- Designate the relationship as \code{other}}
#' \item {Else}
#'     {--- Designate the relationships as \code{no relation.}}}

#' @return List of lists: \{fields: id, \{subfields: parents, pgp, mgp\}\}.
#' Pedigree information converted into a CEPH-style list. The top level
#' list elements are the IDs from id. Below each ID is a list of three
#' elements: parents (sire, dam), paternal grandparents (pgp: sire, dam),
#' and maternal grandparents (mgp: sire, dam).
