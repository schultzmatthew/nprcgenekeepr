#' @param savedGroupMembers list of groups of animals in the form of a vector
#' of animal Ids.
#' @param candidates character vector of IDs of the animals available for

#' @param ped dataframe that is the `Pedigree`. It contains pedigree
#' information including the IDs listed in \code{candidates}.
#' @param minAge integer value indicating the minimum age to consider in group
