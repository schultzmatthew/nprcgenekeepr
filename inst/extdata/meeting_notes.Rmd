1.   Mark met with Amanda to discuss the parent exclusion project and to discuss writing of a paper about nprcgenekeepr. The possible journals she thought of are listed below.
     a. ILAR
     a. Molecular Ecology
     a. Zoo Biology
     a. Journal of Medical Primatology - probably not good for software
     a. Journal of Genomics - check
     
## 20201117

## 20200423
1.  Submission to CRAN was rejected with the following revision requests
    1.  considerably reduce the check time of your package to stay below the
threshold of 10 minutes. This can for example be achieved by:
	      -  Omitting the less important and lengthy tests by only running them
           conditionally if some environment variable is set that you only 
           define on your machine.
	      -  Using precomputed results for the computational intensive parts in
           vignettes.
        -  Ensure that even after this change the package still includes
           illustrative examples of the use of the user-facing functions. 
           Please aim at trying to test and also illustrate the use of as much
           functionality of the package as possible while making considerate use
           of the computational resources.
    1.  Single quotes are used to mark non-English usage, package names, 
        software names, API names and paper titles. Not for names 
        or abbreviations/acronyms. Please omit them where not accurate, 
        e.g. --> Raboin, API,...
    1.  Please only capitalize names, sentence beginnings and 
        abbreviations/acronyms in the description text of your 
        DESCRIPTION file. e.g. -- electronic health records
    1.  Missing Rd-tags:
        -  addGenotype.Rd: \value
        -  agePyramidPlot.Rd: \value
        -  allTrueNoNA.Rd: \value
        -  assignAlleles.Rd: \value
        -  calcFE.Rd: \value
        -  calcFEFG.Rd: \value
        -  calcFG.Rd: \value
        -  calcRetention.Rd: \value
        -  checkGenotypeFile.Rd: \value
        -  convertSexCodes.Rd: \value
        -  create_wkbk.Rd: \value
        -  createExampleFiles.Rd: \arguments,  \value
        -  ...
    1.  You have examples for unexported functions which cannot run in this way.
        Please either add nprcgenekeepr::: to the function calls in the 
        examples, omit these examples or export these functions.
    1.  Please fix and resubmit, and document what was changed in the 
        submission comments.
1.  I will work toward getting these changes in as soon as possible and 
    resubmit.
1.  I have not heard from you regarding the user acceptance testing and am
    curious as whether or not you are going to go forward with that in this
    period of social distancing.

## 20200320
1.  Notes of things to do prior to submission
    1.  Correct spelling package wide - Done 2020319
    1.  Update Development_Plans.Rmd
        -   Updated and cleaned up a bit on 20200319 in preparation.
        -   Sent out a request to Amanda and Matt for input on 20200319. 
            Their input may not arrive before this submission.

## 20200316
1.  Matt will work on colony manager tutorial during last two weeks of March.
1.  Mark will provide user acceptance test questions.
1.  Mark will provide colony manager tutorial material to Matt.
1.  Mark will submit to CRAN during week of March 16, 2020.
1.  Amanda will administer the user acceptance testing to collect feedback on
    using the application. What causes problems, what can and cannot be done, 
    what is missing, what is too complex, etc.
    
## 20200203
1.  Is the tutorial for CRAN or the Consortium users.
    need overview of tab structure and order (left to right).
    1. Notes regarding feedback from Amanda on 20200204
       I am willing to change “reading” to “uploading”, but they do not mean the
       same thing. When you upload a file, there is no inference of paying
       attention to the contents. When reading a file, the contents are examined.
       Reading is the more accurate descriptor in our case.
       
       I am going to write a separate tutorial explicitly for the consortium
       members as typical R users would want conventional use of terms and
       descriptors.
       For example, Shiny apps are always described as Shiny apps.



## 20200106 
1.  Mark will convert nprcmanager to nprcgenekeepr before any other changes.
1.  Amanda will provide notes for the Shiny application tutorial with the 
    following goals.
    a.  Address the specific needs of consortium members.
    a.  Reduce the complexity of the presentation where possible.
    a.  Ensure there are no major components left out.
1.  Amanda will talk to Dave Lawrence about using his code to guide R 
    development of the _Diversity Report_.
1.  Mark will complete submission to CRAN for publication to the consortium.
    a.  Mark expects that the package will be accepted on CRAN once examples 
        have been provided for all exported functions. 
        This is not a trivial matter as there are currently 142 exported 
        functions. 
    a.  Mark will remove exporting of functions that do not need
        to be exported.
    a.  Mark will use code from the unit tests for many of the examples.
1.  Mark has completed only the first of the four items from the 20191120 
    meeting. These will be addressed after the submission to CRAN is successful.

    
## 20191218
1.  Added ability to export each of the six figures on the 
    __Summary Statistics__ page.
1.  Need to update shiny application tutorial to reflect the ability to export 
    each of the six figures on the __Summary Statistics__ page.
    
## 20191130
1.  See if 
    https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Management-of-genetic-diversity-using-gene-dropping-Khaldari-Javaremi/43dd1975193830b9243c8eef672db134e42e871d/figure/3 
    is figure that would be beneficial.
    
## 20191120

1.  Export all graphics
1.  Create, error check and export dawn of time pedigree
1.  Add heuristic to removed recent progeny as founders.
    a.  Add a column - something like "from center" so that "born at site" can 
        be ascertained.
1.  Provide a way to clear focal animals added in __Pedigree Browser__ tab
    so that full pedigree is again available. This will also allow a new 
    pedigree to be added via the __Input__ tab.

## 20191115

1.  Clear out empty text field (_Filter View_) on _Genetic Value Analysis__
    tab. Done 20191115

1.  To meet Friday at 4 PM Pacific to go through entire presentation.
1.  Code changes since August 16, 2016. 
    -   Initial package construction was in March of 2017.
    -   Start of code additions in August 2017.
    -   There are now 736 unit tests covering over 92\% of the code.
    -   Two tutorials have been developed. One to guide R users in the 
        interactive use of the package functions (public API) and one to guide
        users of the Shiny application.
    -   Available via GitHub with MIT license.

1.  __Progress Since Last Meeting__

    a.  Code changes
        -   Added filter to pedigree IDs available for breeding group formation
            so that only animals at the institution (exit == NA) and animals
            with recorded birth dates (birth != NA) are potential breeding
            group members.
    b.  Documentation Updates
        -   Shiny application tutorial first draft is nearly complete.
            Breeding group formation remains.
    c.  CRAN submission preparation
        -   Have begun using RHUB tools to prepare for the CRAN submission.
            -   library(rhub)

## 20190916

1.  __Production Calculation__

    Amanda corrected and clarified how to calculate _Production_ using the 
  
    a.  The Production Status is calculated on September 09, 2019.
    b.  Births = count of all animals in group born since January 1, 2017 
        through December 31, 2018, that lived at least 30 days.
        Animals born after December 31, 2018, are not counted.
    c.  Dams = count of all females in group that have a birth date on or prior 
        to September 09, 2016.
    d.  Production = Births / Dams
    e.  Production Status (color)
        1.   Shelter and pens
             1.   Red -- < 0.51
             1.   Yellow -- >= 0.51 & < 0.54
             1.   Green -- >= 0.54
        1.  Corrals
            1.   Red -- < 0.61
            1.   Yellow -- >= 0.61 & < 0.65
            1.   Green -- >= 0.65
2.   __Genetic Production__

     Percent of females >= 3.5 at the start of the 2 calendar year period that
     have not produced offspring in the past 2 calendar years. Filter out 
     animals over ?? (start with 18) years old.

3.   __Genetic Value Analysis__
     Have Mark look at algorithm and develop simple options for handling 
     progeny that are missing parental information.
     
     One option is to not calculate genetic value of animals < minParentAge.
     
4.   __Founders__
     We need to get a better understanding of the issues surrounding the 
     identification of founders and how founders affect the genetic value
     analysis. 
     As a first step Mark will develop code to list the founders and the count
     of male and female founders. 
     See how they affect the genetic value analysis.
     
     In the very short table below __x123__ has a founder as a dam while
     __x122__ does not have a founder for a sire because of the respective
     values of _dam_from_center_ and _sire_from_center_.

| id  | sire | sire_from_center | dam  |  dam_from_center | birth      |
|-----|------|------------------|------|------------------|------------|
|x123 | s123 | Y                |      |   N              | 1988/04/21 |
|x122 |      | Y                | d123 |   Y              | 1989/08/18 |

5.  __Matt Schultz and R Setup for nprcmanager__

    Mark is to contact Matt to arrange a time to work with him to make sure he
    get nprcmanger set up as a repository on his computer.
    
    Mark will also send the interactive tutorial to him and Amanda.
    Done 20190916.

## 20190810

This was an  _ad hoc_ meeting to get clarification on heat map development for 
genetic diversity reporting. This meeting was a response to questions in a 
July 18, 2019, email from Mark in response to an email from Amanda with the
subject  of "genetic diversity reporting questions".
    
As a result of this meeting, the following columns are defined as follows

1.  GENETIC DIVERSITY REPORTING
    1.   What are the proportions of high and low genetic value breeding-age 
         adults in the group?
         1.   RED > 0.5 LOW VALUE
         1.   0.5 >= YELLOW >= 0.30 LOW VALUE
         1.   GREEN =< 0.3 LOW VALUE
    2.   Are all members of the breeding group Indian-origin rhesus macaques?
         1.   RED -- >= 1 HYBRID OR CHINESE ANIMALS
         1.   YELLOW -- >= 1 BORDERLINE HYBRID ANCESTRY & 
              0 HYBRID OR CHINESE ANIMALS
         1.   GREEN -- 0 HYBRID OR CHINESE ANIMALS & 
              0 BORDERLINE HYBRID ANCESTRY
              
         >= 10% <= 15% chinese: Proportion of chinese ancestry is borderline 
         Yellow; Red > 15%; 
         This information is found under animal history under genetics main tab 
         -- genetic ancestry.
    3.   Among all females in group age >= 3 years what is percentage with a 
         kinship coefficient <= 0.0156 with at least 1 male >= 5 years old in 
         the group.
         1.   Denomonator = count of females >= 3 years of age
         1.   Numerator = count of females with kinship coefficient <= 0.0156
              with at least 1 male >= 5 years old in the group.
         1.   Thresholds
              1.   Red -- < 0.6
              1.   Yellow -- >= 0.6 & <= 0.9
              1.   Green -- > 0.9
    4.   Fecundity
         1.   Denominator = count of females >= 3 years of age
         1.   Numerator = count of births that live > 30 days
         1.   Thresholds

## 20190603
1. Joint Working Group Meeting week before Thanksgiving. 
   We will meet with the Breeding Colony Managers Group. November 19-21, 2019.

1. Work on loop code: have list of animals involved in loops with counts, number of loops, number of animals in loops.
   Not high priority.
1. DCM wants to report on problems in current breeding groups prior occurrence.
   -   Amanda has developed an initial set of questions.
       -   Are all Indian origin?
       -   Has alpha male been in group > 3 years.
       -   Are kinship coefficients of >=0.0156 between male and females >= 2.5 years old
           (settable) within a breeding group. 
       -   Are kinship coefficients of >=0.0156 between males >= 2.5 years old
           (settable) within a breeding group. 
       -   Are offspring equally distributed among female breeders.
       -   Are any members flagged to be genotyped. This likely does not reside in demographics.
1. Does Amanda know what the _2014-10-16_ResPed_v1.1.txt_, 
   _BreedingGroups1_4MendozaTest.csv_, _Jmac_studbook_20180711.csv_,
   _Jmac_studbook_20180711.txt_, and
   _MendozaC1C2newharemstest.csv_ files represent?
   Can they be use for instruction? We are not going to use them. Done 20190622
   Are some to be used with the Example_Pedigree file? We are not going to use 
   them. Done 20190622
1. Decide which pedigree files to leave in package. Done 20190622
   -   All pedigree files except an obfuscated baboon (qcPed) and an obfuscated
       rhesus (examplePedigree) were moved out of the package.
   -   The qcPed and examplePedigree are in the package as data, which can be
       obtained by the user with 
       -   __qcPed <- nprcmanager::qcPed__
       -   __examplePedigree <- nprcmanager::examplePedigree__
   -   Three versions of the qcPed pedigree were included as actual files for
       the getPedigree() unit tests.
1. Figure out how to best provide example pedigree files. 
   See point immediately above. Done 20190622
1. Items brought forward from previous meetings to prevent forgetting them.
   1. From 20190311
      -  Amanda sent Mark the 2015-02-14_Genetic_metrics_white paper_Final.docx 
         paper for him to review and collect ideas for a renewed ORIP Reporting
         tab. Amanda suggested that we need to propose collection of these 
         metrics from all primate centers. 
         Genetic and Genomics Working Group website: 
         https://nprcresearch.org/primate/genetics-genomics/genetics-genomics-working-group.php
   1. From 20190408
         -  Consider adding the ability to ignore founders if the user selects 
            that option. 
         -  Go through all primary data structure names and definitions to update 
            and correct.
         -  Edit all function descriptions to update and correct

## 20190429
1. Updated Amanda's R, R packages, and installed version 0.5.10 (20190428) of
   nprcmanager.
1. Demonstrated that new version of nprcmanager displayed suspicious parent
   table in ErrorTab. Done 20190428
1. Decided on new wording of "One or both parents are below the minimum 
   parental age. Check both parent and offspring birth dates." to place
   before the Suspicious Parents table. Done 20190428
1. Removed row label column in Suspicious Parents table. Done 20190428
1. Plan to add ability to read in pedigrees in Excel format to Input tab. 
   Done 20190519
1. Still need to complete items listed in 20190408 meeting notes. (See below.)
1. Will provide a "Goldilocks" tutorial of Shiny application first.

## 20190408
1. Test for error when pedigree is not available when forming groups
1. Make sure harems are formed correctly when males are in seed animals
1. List of things found prior to the meeting to do before next meeting:
   -  Unit test for fillGroupMembersWithSexRatio() Done 20190328
   -  Go through all primary data structure names and definitions to update 
      and correct.
   -  Edit all function descriptions to update and correct
   -  Correct nprcmanager.R file. This includes the following and more.
      Check, correct, and create where needed function lists including lists
      of all functions, pedigree file testing functions, genetic value 
      functions, plotting functions, breeding group formation functions,
      and gene dropping functions (if possible). Done 20190515
   -  Consider making a summary function for the gvReport structure. 
      Done 20190602
   -  Consider adding the ability to ignore founders if the user selects 
      that option. 
    
 Ballou & Lacy describe genome uniqueness as "the proportion of simulations 
 in which an individual receives the only copy of a founder allele." 
 We have interpreted this as meaning that genome uniqueness should only be 
 calculated  for living, non-founder animals. 
 Alleles possessed by living founders are not considered when calculating 
 genome uniqueness. 

We have a differing view on this, since a living founder can still contribute 
to the population.  The function below calculates genome uniqueness for all 
living animals  and considers all alleles. It does not ignore living founders 
and their  alleles. 

Our results for genome uniqueness will, therefore differ slightly from those 
returned by Pedscope. Pedscope calculates genome uniqueness only for
non-founders and ignores the contribution of any founders in the population.
This will cause Pedscope's genome uniqueness estimates to possibly be 
slightly higher for non-founders than what this function will calculate.

       development of vignettes.
1. Next meeting March 11, 2019, at 4PM PAC.

## 20190114

1. Amanda provided a new logo to use, which represents all of the National 
  Primate Research Centers. This is necessary because the ONPRC parent
  organization does not allow them to have a logo. Mark will incorporate
  that logo into the application and add some comments regarding development
  supported by ONPRC and SNPRC. Added 20190119.
  
1. Discussed harem formation and formation of groups with a set sex ratio.
  Done 20190103.

1. Discussed what to do about overlapping group formation. 
  Decided to instruct the user to run the Make Groups command again to get 
  a new set of groups. The new set will overlap with the prior results, 
  but will be mutually exclusive within a run. Added to things to do
  for 20190225 meeting 20190224

1. Discussed layout of breeding group formation tab by using a mockup tool.
  Decided to have six workflows selectable in a radio button configuration. 
  The user interface
  will redraw based on the radio button selected to reflect the user 
  interface elements needed within the selected workflow. Done 20190224

1. Need to test group formation with a candidate animal not in the pedigree or
  not in the genetic analysis.
  Found that this causes a application crash. Done 20190224

1. Need to test group formation with a candidate animal not in the pedigree or
  not in the genetic analysis.
  Found that groups are not formed, but an error is not displayed. 
  The user must remove the false Id to get group formation to work.
  Done 20190224.

1. Make an error reporting function that informs the user what has occurred
  when an animal not in the pedigree or not in the genetic analysis is 
  entered as a seed animal or a candidate animal.
  
1. Change "Animals will be ignored below this age" to "Animals will be 
  grouped with the mother below age". Done 20190224.

1. Change to Animals with kinship above this value will be excluded.
  Done 20190224.

1. Change to Include kinship in display of groups. Done 20190224.

1. Disable breeding group formation tab until genetic value analysis has
  occurred. Have disabled tab display text explaining that genetic 
  value analysis must be performed first.
  
1. Have 6 boxes for seed animals. User can provide seed animals for up to 
  six groups. Done 20190224

1. The next meeting will be 20190211 at 4 PM Pacific time.    

## 20181210

1. Mark reported that he was having trouble implementing the user interface 
  elements needed for items 4 and 5 of the 20181105 meeting notes.
  Specifically the need to have dynamically generated text input boxes
  for the number of groups to be formed is the issue. 
  He has not figured out either
  the desired interface behavior or the technical methods needed for 
  this feature. This is going to delay getting the tutorials written,
  which he had hoped to complete in first draft form during December. 
  
  After some discussion, all agreed that the features described in items 
  4 and 5 are sufficiently important to delay the preparation of the 
  tutorials and subsequent technical paper a few weeks. Thus, Mark
  will work on getting these implemented in December with plans on 
  working on the tutorials in January.
  
  Ability to form harems. Done 20181230.
  
  Ability to form breeding groups with specified sex ratios. Done 20180103.
  
1. Amanda and Mark had fairly extensive discussions regarding how group
  selection is to be done. The current software forms groups so that 
  there is no overlap of animals among any of the groups. The plan
  is for Mark to implement a group selection procedure that will make
  two types of groups. 
  
  One group type is what is currently done by the software (no overlap
  of animals among any of the groups formed.) These groups will
  be made up of all of the animals that can be used in groups based
  on kinship and sex ratio criteria such that none of the groups have
  any individuals in common.
  
  The second type of group is a collection of sub-groups where each
  sub-group is a group of the first type. Thus, there is no overlap
  of animals within any one sub-group of groups and there is 
  potential overlay among the various subgroups. This is complected
  and hard to follow so it is illustrated 
  with the list below where each letter represent a specific animal.
  Overlapping Groups 1-4 have within
  them sets of animal that have no animals in common with other unique
  sets within the group.
  
  For example, animal __H__ appears in set 1 of each overlapping group, 
  but it does not appear more than once in any on group. Also, animal
  __E__ appears in group 1, 2, and 4 and not in group 3.

```{r group-formation, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(stringi)
overlapping_groups <- list()
for (i in 1:4) {
 unique <- sample(LETTERS, 15, replace = FALSE)
 group <- stri_c("Overlap_Group_", i)
 overlapping_groups[[group]] <- data.frame(unique_set_1 = unique[1:5], 
                unique_set_2 = unique[6:10],
                unique_set_3 = unique[11:15], 
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE )
}
overlapping_str <- sapply(overlapping_groups, function(x) {
 stri_c("Unique Set 1: ", stri_c(x[[1]], collapse = ","), "\n",
     "Unique Set 2: ", stri_c(x[[2]], collapse = ","), "\n",
     "Unique Set 3: ", stri_c(x[[3]], collapse = ","), "\n")
})
cat(overlapping_str)

```

  -  Overlapping Group 1
    -  Unique Set 1: I,B,J,L,H
    -  Unique Set 2: D,G,U,S,Q
    -  Unique Set 3: E,P,F,A,C
  -  Overlapping Group 2
    -  Unique Set 1: M,V,H,Z,K
    -  Unique Set 2: O,T,W,D,X
    -  Unique Set 3: C,J,E,F,B
  -  Overlapping Group 3
    -  Unique Set 1: H,I,F,X,K
    -  Unique Set 2: Q,Y,A,D,S
    -  Unique Set 3: T,B,C,G,M
  -  Overlapping Group 4
    -  Unique Set 1: H,V,I,T,Z
    -  Unique Set 2: E,W,M,N,O
    -  Unique Set 3: P,Q,J,G,U


1.  Amanda and Mark are to develop a better descriptor for the button that causes
   the pedigree information to be read in tested and sent to the pedigree
   browser function. Mark has changed it to _Read and Check Pedigree_ for now. 
   Done 20181212.
1.  Mark is to reorganize the __Input__ tab to place the description of the 
   minimum parent age in hovertext and make the check pedigree button more 
   evident. Done 20181212.
1.  The next meeting will be 20190114 at 4 PM Pacific time.    


## 20181105
1. Do not report as an error the wrong sex for animals added into the pedigree
  and appear as both a sire and dam without an ego record. 
  These need to be reported as an error because they are both a sire and a
  dam. Done 20181208
2. Make a combined logo for Oregon and SNPRC. Have ONPRC on top using blue and
  green. Check on the University of Oregon website for a color palette. 
  Have ONPRC in the lighter color similar to the SNPRC color scheme. 
  Have the macaque and oval in the same blue color. 
  Clean up the resolution of the Oregon logo as it is currently fuzzy.
  Some research found the following link [OHSU Color Palette][ohsupalette].

  - Navigation background lighter #F3F3F3 
  - Promo background #F3F3F3 
  - Subsite name in header type #0E4D8F
  Done 20181208
3. Check the outliers found in the first box and whisker plot when the file
  "Example_Pedigree.csv" is analyzed. The outliers are exactly as described:
  Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called "outlying" points and are 
  plotted individually. The jittered points are overlaid on top of the 
  boxplot and its outliers. Done 20181112
4. Add the ability to select a sex ratio for group formation. 
  Ratios are to be female to male starting with 1:1 and progressing by 0.5
  on the female side, holding the male side at 1. Go up to a ratio of 10:1.
  The progression will look something like 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 2.5:1 ... 10:1.
5. Add the ability to use harems with 1 male and any number of females. One 
  way to do this would be to put any number of males in with the females in 
  the list of candidates and then specify that single male harems are to 
  be formed with a specified number of groups formed. This will allow the
  select of the best males to be selected from the excess male candidates. 
6. Beth is to contact Mark at least a week prior to the next meeting to set 
  up a time to diagnose why her installation of the software is not working.
  Rcpp package was not being replaced during installation and update of 
  other packages. This prevented nprcmanager from being installed. Beth
  manually removed the old version of the Rcpp package, installed a newer
  version and then installed nprcmanager and rmsutilityr. Mark will do 
  some research to see if others have reported similar problems.
  Working with Beth prompted the development of a function that reports
  the version of the application on the input tab so users can easily 
  find out which version they are using.
  Done 20181109.
7. Until we work on LabKey connectivity again, we have decided to postpone 
  Item 2 from two meetings ago: Give user the option to save a skeleton 
  configuration file to their home directory if they do not have a 
  configuration file.
8. We reaffirmed the plan for Mark to finish the tutorials (one for an
  interactive use of the software and one for using the Shiny application)
  and to get a draft of a technical paper written by the end of the year.
9. Not discussed during the meeting was the need to develop additional unit 
  tests to cover all of the new functions created to handle the PEDSYS and
  military formatted dates (YYYYMMDD), which look like an integer. 
  Most of those unit tests have been made, but additional ones are needed to
  provide full or near full coverage. Done 20181112
10. Miscellaneous
  - Found that breeding groups being formed included unknown animals that 
    had been added as placeholders for unknown parents. Those were removed
    from consideration. Done 20181119
  - Worked with Terry Hawkins on 20181119 and 20181120 to make sure the 
    LabKey code was working. He had an error in his
    base URL specification so that initial efforts failed and the error
    message was misleading. I have trapped the error with a tryCatch 
    function and am sending a message to the log file. This needs to be
    tested.
11. The next meeting is scheduled for 20181126. Due to conflicts in Mark's 
   schedule, we rescheduled for 20181210.


## 20181022 
1. Allow the use of Ego for ID. Done 20181022
2. Remove the display of the change columns. Done 20181103
3. Remove old error tabs each time a file browsing occurs. Done 20181103
4. List columns that should be there id, sire, dam, sex, birth when columns 
  are listed as missing. Done 20181103
5. Improve the reporting of multiple errors of the same type. 
  Perhaps "The first 5 records have the following errors: <then list the errors
  followed by the next sentence>. In total there were <number of records> records
  with the same type of error. Please check and correct the pedigree file."
  Changes are improved over the suggestions above, but similar. Done 20181103
6. Correct "Genetic Uniqueness Score" to "Genome Uniqueness Score". 
  Done 20181022
7. Item 2 from last meeting list: Give user the option to save a skeleton 
  configuration file to their home directory if they do not have a 
  configuration file.
8. During the next meeting, we will work with Beth on clearly defining how 
  breeding group formation tab should work. In the mean time, Mark will examine
  the current behavior and code so that he understands exactly what is being
  done.
9. The near term goal is to produce a technical paper within the next six months 
  that describes the software. Mark will get this started by completing two tutorial
  documents. The first will be a tutorial on how to use the major functions from the 
  R console in an interactive mode. The second will be a tutorial on how to use the 
  Shiny application. The first tutorial should be completed some time in December.
10. Amanda and Mark discussed the goal of enhancing the scope of software to include 
  the ability to do phenotype -- genotype association studies. Amanda has some 
  ideas regarding direction. Mark needs some guidance as to what techniques to 
  investigate.
  
  Below are some relevant articles found from a simple
  web search with the Google search engine using the search elements:
  "genetic association studies in pedigrees"
  *  https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~mcvean/gwa4.pdf
  *  https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2F1753-6561-8-S1-S26

  *  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12687644
11. Not mentioned during the meeting but taken from other correspondence. Mark will
  Contact Daniel Nicolalde (fdnicolalde@primate.wisc.edu; (608) 890-4592; 
  INFORMATICS AND DATA SERVICES) to see if he will assist in getting the LabKey 
  interface working with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center system.
12. The next meeting is scheduled for November 5, 2018 at 4 PM Pacific Time.
  
## 20180917

1. Change Pedigree browser button label to say "Trim pedigree based on focal animals". Done 20180917
2. Give user the option to save a skeleton configuration file to their home directory if they do not have a configuration file.
3. Incorporate the error detection functions into the shiny application so that if a defective pedigree file is selected by the user a new tab is created with a description of the errors detected.
  a. The user should be moved to the error report tab. Done 20181020
  b. The error report tab should be placed immediately after the input tab. Changed to immediately before the input tab. Done 20181020
4. Beth is to try the current (0.3.31) or later version of nprcmanager with the pedigree file that has been failing. 
  a. If that file still causes an error, Beth is to send it to Mark. 
  Received file from Beth 20181018.
  b. Mark will change the code to better handle the issues observed, update the package, and have Beth test again.
  All code changes made for all known file errors completed 20181020.
  
## 20180820

Meeting was canceled.

### Summary Statistics tab

1. Use default box and whisker plot with red dots for outliers.
  a. Changes made. Done 2018-07-14
  b. Hover text to box and whisker plots added. Done 2018-07-14

### Pedigree Browser tab
1. Change Update breeding colony button to "" Waiting on Amanda. Changed to "Update Focal Animals" based on instructions from Amanda. Done 2018-08-04
2. Add function to "Update Breeding Colony" button to browse for a file; add animal IDs to the window where they could be pasted. Started 2018-07-29 getting file not updating window. Done 2018-08-15
3. Change first bullet point to reflect change in function of the "Update Focal Animal" button. Done 2018-08-15
4. Move first bullet point to far right. Done 2018-08-15
5. Remove second bullet point. However, provide this information when the file has any type of error. This is complete for one error at a time. Currently the __qcStudbook__ function does not continue scanning the file when an error is found. Done 2018-07-17
6. Change "Display UIDs for partial parentage" to "Display UIDs". Consider coming up with a better name than "UID". Add hovertext to explain what this button does. Proposed explanatory text: "Unknown IDs are created by the application for all animals with only one parent. They begin with a capital __U__." Done 2018-08-15
7. Change "Trim pedigree based on specified population" to "Trim Pedigree". Add hovertext to explain what this button does. See what "Trim Pedigree" button does. Does it remove animals? Its intent is to reduce the number of animals being examined. It does reduce the number by removing all individuals not related to the focal animals. Does it change genetic analysis. It does not change the genetic analysis for the animals left. Obviously for animals removed, it does. The name of this button will likely follow from what the new name for "Update Breeding Colony" button. Done 2018-08-16
8. Add a better description for the Search field. Done 2018-08-16

### Error Handling
1. Develop a full set of error messages appropriate for all types of input files.
  a. Added improved error detection and reporting for missing required columns - Done 2018-07-17
  b. Added the ability to call qcStudbook interactively with a flag (__reportErrors__) set to TRUE that 
  causes qcStudbook to report back a list with all errors detected within the input file.
  Not all errors can be detected in a single pass because some errors preclude checking for others.
  For example, if the birth date column has an invalid format, the parental age cannot be checked.
  If no errors are found with __reportErrors__ set to TRUE and NULL value is returned.
  __reportErrors__ defaults to __FALSE__.
  c. This emphasizes the need for a good set of corrupt input files for testing and unit test
  development.
2. Amanda and Beth will provide me with some files with errors.
  a. Amanda provided a file with two error types: bad birth date type - integer instead of character representation of a date and animal appearing as a sire and a dam. Done 20180720
  b. Both errors were caught, but the first error was only seen after correcting the first. It would be better to report all errors and set a flag that told the program to stop at the end of parsing the entire pedigree.
  c. Three files were added to the example files: _Example_Pedigree.csv_, 
  _Pedigree_File_Example_134M_dam_removed.csv_, and _Pedigree_File_Example_CSV.csv_ Done 20180721
  d. These files need to be documented.
3. Refactored some code within __qcStudbook__ to a separate function __unknown2NA__. Done 2018-07-18
4. Added bad date string format detection in __convertDates__, which is now __convertDate__. 
Also added unit tests for __convertDate__. Done 2018-07-21
5. Added ability to handle dates with NA to __convertDates__ Done 2018-07-22
6. Added unit test coverage of __updateProgress__ calls in _test_reportGV.R_ Done 2018-07-22
7. Corrected a bug and added corollary unit test for __rankSubjects__. Done 2018-07-29
8. Added test for missing __age__ column in _orderReport_ function. This also allows correct
ordering when the age column is missing. Done 2018-07-29
9. Added unit tests for _findLoops_ function. Done 2018-07-30
10. Added check for class on objects in _convertDates_ function, because it was failing when 
objects were already dates. It now passes those objects through untouched. Done 2018-08-04
11. Added some debug code for updating focal animals (still named breeding colony update in code) Done 2018-08-15

### Multiple tabs
1. Come up with a different word for "Breeders". What do you think about _Managed Animals_
  a. Amanda suggested _Focal Animals_ -- this is being adopted.

### Miscellaneous items
1. Added automatic generation of a web site
  a. 2018-07-17 first draft
  b. Need to first move content that has been prepared to the correct location. Done 2018-08-16
2. Changed read.csv to read.table in code to emphasize we are able to read multiple file types.
  a. 2018-07-17
3. Amended documentation for the __addGenotype__ function to indicate that it is assuming 
the _genotype_ object was opened by __checkGenotypeFile__. 2018-07-17
4. Added use of convenience functions __get_and_or_list__ and __is_valid_data_str__ from the _github/rmsharp/rmsharp/rmsutilityr_ repository. 2018-07-21
5. Added documentation for data elements __finalRpt__ and __rpt__, which are both created by the _reportGV_ 
function. 2018-07-29
6. Added brief tutorial on how to use _findLoops_ function. 2018-08-04

### Questions that came up after the meeting
1. What is the meaning of the following:
  a. Text under __Export__ button on _Pedigree Browser_ tab. 
  ``A population must be defined before proceeding to the Genetic Value Analysis''.
  b. Check box above __Export__ button on _Pedigree Browser_ tab. 
  ``Trim pedigree based on specified population''. 
  Its intent is to reduce the number of animals being examined. 
  It does reduce the number by removing all individuals not related 
  to the focal animals. Does it change genetic analysis. 
  It does not change the genetic analysis for the animals left. 
  Obviously for animals removed, it does. Done 2018-08-16

## 20180501 Meeting Notes

1. The second bullet point under the Input File Handling section of the Input tab says "Please be aware that animals with no parents will be treated as founders in these calculations, i.e., sources of new genetic variation in the colony."

I am assuming that this is fine and stated only to keep users aware that if they have parental information it has to be entered.

2. The third bullet point under the Input File Handling section of the Input tab says "Designation of two alleles is required as currently there is no accommodation for partial genetic information for an individual."

Is this will be a problem that needs to be addressed?

3. Reminder for Mark only: The third bullet point under the Input File Handling section of the Input tab says "If the Age column is provided, the program will use the user-specified age."

Make sure this is true. I may also want to check for internal inconsistencies.

4. In the Input File Handling section of the Input tab the last bullet point immediately above the first table says "Genotype data may be supplied within the pedigree file or in a separate genotype file. Only two additional columns (first and second) are required when the genotypes are provided within the pedigree file."

This should be explained more fully and the program behavior may need to be changed. Currently the program assumes the columns first and second are there and are correctly formed. Currently there is no check to ensure that first_name and second_name data elements are consistent with first and second data elements.

5. In the Input File Handling section of the Input tab and under the first table of column names, there is a section describing what is done by the qcStudbook function to correct data and create new columns.

Should we provide a summary of changes made to the input data such as changes in column names, sex identifiers, etc., removal of duplicated rows and columns that are added?

Need name for genotype (first_name, second_name)
Need new name for breeders only file type.
Reword "Animals without birth dates are not considered."
When minimum parent age is included, animals without birth dates are not rejected.

Change update breeding colony (pedigree browser) by adding explanatory text.

## Miscellaneous Accomplishments

These should be stored elsewhere

#### 20180429
Test coverage is 86.32%.

#### 20171004
Unit test coverage is 84.79%.

#### 20170921
Unit test coverage is about 15%.

#### 20170919
We have successfully installed and used _nprcmanager_ on Microsoft (MS) 
Windows 7, MS Windows 10, and MacOS 10.12.6 running R 3.4.1.

#### 20170917
I discovered why the plot of genetic uniqueness scores was not as expected. 
It was from an analysis where 0 was the threshold setting, which I think we 
should consider removing as an option. I have set the default to 3, 
which is what Amanda Vinson's paper indicated that ONPRC typically used.

I got the logging system integrated into the package. 
I am using the package futile.logger (funny name). Note the check box at the 
bottom of the side panel on the two attached images. 
When the Debug on check box is checked (it is not checked by default), 
the application writes to a file in the users home directory named
_nprcmanager.log_. Currently I am only logging events occurring the the 
_server.R_ file, because that is where I tend to have most of my problems 
show up. I have attached an example file in which turned on logging at the 
debug level and then read in a couple of pedigree files.

I added code coverage reports to the automated build system running on 
Travis-CI.org. Currently we only have 5.68% of the code being tested with the 
unit tests I created thus far. I do not know the code well enough to know what 
percentage we will have when I feel comfortable, but I know most of the 
functions have no tests at all.

#### 20170916
Can now assign known genotypes to individuals and to 
incorporate that information into the gene dropping routine.
This has been done at the function level in the _geneDrop_ function. 
The pedigree submitted via the UI can optionally contain
genetic information. 

#### 20170915
Added a genetic uniqueness plot to the Summary Statistics tab.

#### 20170911
I have connected the Travis CI (continuous integration) tool to my 
github.com/rmsharp/nprcmanager so that when I check in code it automatically
tries to build it from scratch using packages from CRAN. Travis CI is now 
automatically building nprcmanager without errors or warnings. 
This puts us considerably closer to being able to offer the package via 
CRAN if we want.

## 20170323 Meeting notes

I met with Jack Kent, Deborah Newman, and Charles Peterson about how to use
genetic data in a gene dropping simulation.

From: R. Mark Sharp <msharp@TxBiomed.org>

Subject: Re: Genetic management of colonies

Date: March 23, 2017 at 5:01:07 PM CDT

To: Jack Kent <jkent@txbiomed.org>

Cc: Deborah Newman <dnewman@txbiomedgenetics.org>, 
Charles Peterson <charlesp@txbiomed.org>

Jack, Debbie, and Charles,

Thank you for meeting with me. I appreciate your help in clarifying the 
various stages of the issues associated with providing genetic management 
guidance via simulation with partially known MHC data. 

1. I will look more closely into what will be needed to add genetic 
information and gene frequency information into the gene dropping routines 
in the kinship2 package. The initial implementation will use only a single 
locus, which should be a sufficient for MHC data

	A. First step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children of individuals when we provide genetic data to all founders using 
	a gene frequency based algorithm.

	B. Second step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children when all parental generations have fully known genotypes.

	C. Third step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children when parental generations have partially known genotypes and all 
	other genotypes are uninformative.

	D. Fourth step will be to ensure we get expected proportions of genes in 
	children when parental generations have partially known genotypes and 
	remaining parental genes are determined by gene frequency.

2. We will not worry about getting rid of genes in the pedigrees since colony 
managers need only not breed animals that carry unwanted alleles.

3. I will produce a small number of pedigree drawings using the data Debbie 
has provided to get feedback on preferences and additional requirements.

4. I will not deal with paternity and maternity issues within the pedigrees 
at this time.

Thanks again.
